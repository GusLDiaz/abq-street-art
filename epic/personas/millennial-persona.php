			<p>Needs: Tara is planning a Saturday afternoon with friends. They are going to walk around downtown ABQ and locate
				nearby sculptures and murals to use in their selfies for Instagram and Tinder. Tara will be using her iPhone 7 to navigate downtown art and take photos. They also plan to stop for
