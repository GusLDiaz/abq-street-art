	<h2>Use Case</h2>
	<p>Greg has finished his Innovate New Mexico conference early at the Galeria in downtown Albuquerque. He has a few hours to kill before his dinner meeting and he would like to check out the murals and art around town. He needs to be able to load the database and associated maps without much fuss. He would like to be able to make notes</p>
