		<h2>Executive Summary:</h2>
		<p>ABQ Street Art is a mobile-first website that allows users to explore public art in Downtown Albuquerque. By integrating with the Google Maps API and pulling information about artwork from the <a href="http://coagisweb.cabq.gov/arcgis/rest/services/public/PublicArt/MapServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&text=&objectIds=&time=&geometry=&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&inSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&relationParam=&outFields=*&returnGeometry=true&maxAllowableOffset=&geometryPrecision=&outSR=&returnIdsOnly=false&returnCountOnly=false&orderByFields=&groupByFieldsForStatistics=&outStatistics=&returnZ=false&returnM=false&gdbVersion=&returnDistinctValues=false&f=pjson" target="_blank"> Public Art Database,</a> users will be able to learn more about each piece of art and its artist. Users can also bookmark locations, comment on artwork photos, and opt-in to receive notifications when they are near a piece of public art. If we have time remaining after implementing these key features, we will also include one or two predetermined routes that users can follow.</p>
